        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This is a group for anyone, of any skill level and background,
            interested in the development, engineering, and craft of building
            and designing software. Topics may include code katas, SOLID design
            discussions, TDD, agile development, various programming languages
            and frameworks, code retreat events, volunteer work, mentoring,
            and anything the group is interested in as we move forward. If you
            have a topic that you'd like to present (be that for 15 minutes,
            an hour, or whatever you need) let us know and we'll set it up! The
            skills and interests of our regular members range from .NET,
            Android, and front-end design, to embedded programming, Azure, game
            development, Ruby and clean code. We welcome everyone!</p>
        <p>I started this group to meet other people interested in software
            development in the valley, to learn and grow, and to provide a
            place for beginners to come to get started in programming and
            software engineering. By building up the community we'll each be
            able to improve and help others grow along the way. I'm looking
            forward to meeting more Software Crafters in the area!</p>
        <p>Software Crafters are people who write software and care about
            self-improvement, quality, continuous learning and helping one
            another. These people come from a variety of backgrounds and
            experiences. Together we can help each other learn and grow.
            Companies like 8th Light promote this type of mentality and use the
            "Software Crafter" job title which is why I chose the name
            "Kalispell Software Crafters".</p>
        <p>If you have any questions, comments, suggestions or concerns feel
            free to message me (Travis) or any of the other organizers
            (Skyler and Sam) anytime!</p>
        <p>Kalispell Software Crafters is dedicated to a harassment-free
            experience for everyone. Be that at an event or within our
            Slack/Discord community. Please review our anti-harassment
            <a href="https://github.com/kalispell-software-crafters/code-of-conduct">policy</a></p>
        <h2>Beginners</h2>
        <p>For beginners, try checking out freeCodeCamp.org, code.org, or Khan
            Academy to get started in learning more about computer programming.
            There's even a local group on Facebook to get help from others
            (search for freeCodeCamp Kalispell -
            https://www.facebook.com/groups/free.code.camp.kalispell.mt/ ).
            You should also ask us about our Slack group! You're more than
            welcome to attend any meeting we have and bring your questions along.
            We also have a regular "Software Engineering Roundtable" meeting which
            is a great place to have your questions answered (from general
            questions to specific problems you're dealing with as you learn).</p>
